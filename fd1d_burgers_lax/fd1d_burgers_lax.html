      Finite Difference Non-viscous Burgers Equation<br>
      Lax-Wendroff Method
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD1D_BURGERS_LAX</b> is a MATLAB program which
      solves the nonviscous time-dependent Burgers equation using finite differences
      and the Lax-Wendroff method.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function u(x,t) is to be solved for in the equation:
      <blockquote>
        du/dt + u * du/dx = 0
      </blockquote>
      for a &lt;= x &lt;= b and t_init &lt;= t &lt;= t_last.
    </p>

    <p>
      Problem data includes an initial condition for u(x,t_init), and the boundary
      value functions u(a,t) and u(b,t).
    </p>

    <p>
      The non-viscous Burgers equation can develop shock waves or discontinuities.
