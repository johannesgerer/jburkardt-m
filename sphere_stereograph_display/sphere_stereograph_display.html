      Visualize the Stereographic Projection
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_DISPLAY</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      demonstrates the stereographic projection between a sphere and a plane
      by displaying a set of points and their images under the mapping.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is primarily an auxilliary demonstration of the properties
      of the <b>SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH</b> library; it is not a standalone application,
      and while it can be used to understand how to compute and display
      stereographic projections, a considerable amount of user modifications
      would be needed to adapt it to each particular problem of interest.
