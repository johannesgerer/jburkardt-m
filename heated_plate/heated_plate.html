      HEATED_PLATE <br> 2D Steady State Heat Equation in a Rectangle
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HEATED_PLATE</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      solves the steady state heat equation in a 2D
      rectangular region, and is intended as
      a starting point for a parallel version.
    </p>

    <p>
      The final estimate of the solution is written to a file in a format
      suitable for display by <b>GRID_TO_BMP</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sequential version of this program needs approximately
      18/epsilon iterations to complete. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The physical region, and the boundary conditions, are suggested
      by this diagram:
      <pre>
                   W = 0
             +------------------+
             |                  |
    W = 100  |                  | W = 100
             |                  |
             +------------------+
                   W = 100
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The region is covered with a grid of M by N nodes, and an N by N
      array W is used to record the temperature.  The correspondence between
      array indices and locations in the region is suggested by giving the
      indices of the four corners:
      <pre>
                  I = 0
          [0][0]-------------[0][N-1]
             |                  |
      J = 0  |                  |  J = N-1
             |                  |
        [M-1][0]-----------[M-1][N-1]
                  I = M-1
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The steady state solution to the discrete heat equation satisfies the
      following condition at an interior grid point:
      <blockquote>
        W[Central] = (1/4) * ( W[North] + W[South] + W[East] + W[West] )
      </blockquote>
      where "Central" is the index of the grid point, "North" is the index
      of its immediate neighbor to the "north", and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given an approximate solution of the steady state heat equation, a
      "better" solution is given by replacing each interior point by the
      average of its 4 neighbors - in other words, by using the condition
      as an ASSIGNMENT statement:
      <blockquote>
        W[Central]  &lt;=  (1/4) * ( W[North] + W[South] + W[East] + W[West] )
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      If this process is repeated often enough, the difference between successive 
      estimates of the solution will go to zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program carries out such an iteration, using a tolerance specified by
      the user, and writes the final estimate of the solution to a file that can
      be used for graphic processing.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>heated_plate</b> ( <i>epsilon</i>, <i>output_filename</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>epsilon</i> is the error tolerance used to halt the iteration.  This 
          is an absolute error tolerance, and is applied pointwise.  A value of
          0.1 might be reasonable for the built in problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>output_filename</i> is the name of the file into which the final 
          estimate of the solution will be written, for possible display by 
          <b>GRID_TO_BMP</b>.
        </li>
