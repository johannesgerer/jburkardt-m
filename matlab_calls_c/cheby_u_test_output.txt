CHEBY_U_TEST
  MATLAB version
  Demonstrate a simple use of the MEX compiler,
  which allows MATLAB to call C functions.

  Get a directory listing.  The file CHEBY_U.C should be there.
cheby_u.c	cheby_u_test_output.txt  fact.mexa64  fact_test_output.txt
cheby_u_test.m	fact.c			 fact_test.m  matlab_calls_c.html


  Compile the file CHEBY_U.C.

Warning: You are using gcc version "4.4.7".  The version
         currently supported with MEX is "4.3.4".
         For a list of currently supported compilers see: 
         http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/current_release/


  Get a directory listing.  A new file should show up,
  containing the compiled information.
cheby_u.c	cheby_u_test_output.txt  fact_test.m
cheby_u.mexa64	fact.c			 fact_test_output.txt
cheby_u_test.m	fact.mexa64		 matlab_calls_c.html


  Now use CHEBY_U as though it were a MATLAB M-file
  function.
