%
%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, real X, the argument of the PDF.
%
%    Input, real A, B, shape parameters of the PDF,
%    used to transform the argument X to a shifted and scaled 
%    value Y = ( X - A ) / B.  It is required that B be nonzero.
%    For the standard distribution, A = 0 and B = 1.
%
%    Input, real C, is usually called the number of 
%    degrees of freedom of the distribution.  C is typically an 
%    integer, but that is not essential.  It is required that
%    C be strictly positive.
%
%    Output, real MEAN, the mean of the PDF.
