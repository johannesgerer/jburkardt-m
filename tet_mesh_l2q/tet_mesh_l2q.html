      TET_MESH_L2Q <br> 10-Node Tet Mesh <br> from <br> 4-Node Tet Mesh
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TET_MESH_L2Q</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      converts a 4-node tetrahedral mesh ("tet mesh") into a 10-node tet mesh.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, <b>TET_MESH_L2Q</b> reads information
      describing a set of 3D points, and a 4 node ("linear")
      tet mesh of those points.  It creates a "quadratic" tet
      mesh, which has the same number of tetrahedrons, but in
      which each tetrahedron is defined by 10 nodes.  In the process,
      it adds just enough nodes, at the midsides of the edges of
      the original mesh, to define the new mesh.  The data defining
      the new mesh is written out to files for further use.
    </p>

    <p>
      The refinement of a single tetrahedron is easy.  Every pair
      of nodes generates a new node whose location is the average of
      the locations of the original two nodes.  The problem is that
      many tetrahedrons may share the same edge.  The new node needs
      to be generated exactly once, and assigned a unique index, which
      all the tetrahedrons will share.  The tricky part of this calculation
      is thus figuring out whether it is time to generate a new node, or
      whether the node has already been generated, in which case the
      appropriate index must be retrieved.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>tet_mesh_l2q</b> ( <i>'prefix'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i>_nodes.txt contains the node definitions;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i>_elements.txt contains the element definitions;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i>_l2q_nodes.txt contains the new node definitions;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i>_l2q_elements.txt contains the new element definitions;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The input and output files use the simple TABLE format;
      comment lines begin with a "#" character.  Otherwise, each line
      of the file contains one set of information, either the coordinates
      of a node (for a node file), or the indices of nodes that make up
      a tetrahedron, (for a tetrahedron file).
    </p>

    <p>
      The input file <i>prefix_nodes.txt</i> contains the coordinate information
      for the 4-node tet mesh.  Each data line contains the X and
      Y coordinates of a single node.
    </p>

    <p>
      The input file <i>prefix_elements.txt</i> contains the tetrahedron information
      for the 4-node tet mesh.  Each data line contains the indices
      of four nodes that form a tetrahedron.
    </p>

    <p>
      The output file <i>prefix_l2q_nodes.txt</i> contains the coordinate information
      for the 10-node tet mesh.  The data lines begin with the node
      information from <i>nodes.txt</i>, followed by the coordinates of
      the new nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The output file <i>prefix_l2q_elements.txt</i> contains the tetrahedron
      information for the 10-node tet mesh.  There are exactly
      as many tetrahedrons as before, but now each tetrahedron uses 10 nodes.
      Each line of the file contains the indices of 10 nodes that form the
      tetrahedron, listed in a particular order.  The first four
      node indices are the same as for the linear tet mesh.  The next six
      node indices may be thought of as being obtained as averages of
      pairs of the first four nodes.  Symbolically, this may be thought of as:
      <pre>
        1  2  3  4 (1+2) (1+3) (1+4) (2+3) (2+4) (3+4)
      </pre>
