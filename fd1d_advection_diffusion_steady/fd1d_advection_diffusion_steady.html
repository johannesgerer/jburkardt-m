      Steady 1D Advection Diffusion Equation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD1D_ADVECTION_DIFFUSION_STEADY</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which
      applies the finite difference method to solve the
      steady advection diffusion equation v*ux-k*uxx=0 in 
      one spatial dimension, with constant velocity v and diffusivity k.
    </p>

    <p>
      We solve the steady constant-velocity advection diffusion equation in 1D,
      <pre>
        v du/dx - k d^2u/dx^2
      </pre>
      over the interval:
      <pre>
        0.0 <= x <= 1.0
      </pre>
      with boundary conditions
      <pre>
        u(0) = 0, u(1) = 1.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      We do this by discretizing the interval [0,1] into NX nodes.
      We write the boundary conditions at the first and last nodes.
      At the i-th interior node, we replace derivatives by differences:
      <ul>
        <li>
          du/dx = (u(x+dx)-u(x-dx))/2/dx
        </li>
        <li>
          d^2u/dx^2 = (u(x+dx)-2u(x)+u(x-dx))/dx/dx
        </li>
      </ul>
      This becomes a set of NX linear equations in the NX unknown values of U.
    </p>

    <p>
      The exact solution to this differential equation is known:
      <pre>
        u = ( 1 - exp ( r * x ) ) / ( 1 - exp ( r ) )
      </pre>
      where r = v * l / k;
