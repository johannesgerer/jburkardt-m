      FEM2D_HEAT <br>
      Finite Element Solution of the Heat Equation <br>
      on a Triangulated Region
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_HEAT</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      applies the finite element method to solve
      a form of the time-dependent heat equation over an arbitrary
      triangulated region.
    </p>

    <p>
      The computational region is initially unknown by the program.  The user
      specifies it by preparing a file containing the coordinates of
      the nodes, and a file containing the indices of nodes that make
      up triangles that form a triangulation of the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally, the user does not type in this information by hand, but has
      a program fill in the nodes, and perhaps another program that
      constructs the triangulation.  However, in the simplest case,
      the user might construct a very crude triangulation by hand, and
      have <a href = "../../m_src/triangulation_refine/triangulation_refine.html">
      TRIANGULATION_REFINE</a> refine it to something more reasonable.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the following ridiculously small example:
      <pre>
       10-11-12
        |\   |\
        | \  | \
        6  7 8  9
        |   \|   \
        1-2--3--4-5
      </pre>
      the node file would be:
      <pre>
         0.0  0.0
         1.0  0.0
         2.0  0.0
         3.0  0.0
         4.0  0.0
         0.0  1.0
         1.0  1.0
         2.0  1.0
         3.0  1.0
         0.0  2.0
         1.0  2.0
         2.0  2.0
      </pre>
      and the element file would be
      <pre>
         1  3 10  2  7  6
         3  5 12  4  9  8
        12 10  3 11  7  8
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is set up to handle the time dependent heat
      equation with a right hand side function, and nonhomogeneous
      Dirichlet boundary conditions.   The state variable
      U(T,X,Y) is then constrained by:
      <pre>
        Ut - ( Uxx + Uyy ) + K(x,y,t) * U = F(x,y,t)  in the region
                                        U = G(x,y,t)  on the boundary
                                        U = H(x,y,t)  at initial time TINIT.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      To specify the right hand side function F(x,y,t), the linear
      coefficient K(x,y,t), the boundary condition function G(x,y,t),
      and the initial condition H(x,y,t),
      the user has to supply the functions,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>FUNCTION F = RHS ( NODE_NUM, NODE_XY, TIME )</b> evaluates the
          right hand side forcing term F(x,y,t);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>FUNCTION K = K_COEF ( NODE_NUM, NODE_XY, TIME )</b> evaluates K(x,y,t);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>FUNCTION G = DIRICHLET_CONDITION ( NODE_NUM, NODE_XY, TIME )</b>
          evaluates G(x,y,t) for nodes on the boundary;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>FUNCTION H = INITIAL_CONDITION ( NODE_NUM, NODE_XY, TIME )</b>
          evaluates H(x,y,t), and is only called for TIME = TINIT.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program writes out a file containing the
      solution value at every node.  This file may be used to create
      contour plots of the solution.
