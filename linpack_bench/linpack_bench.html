      LINPACK_BENCH <br> The LINPACK Benchmark
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LINPACK_BENCH</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      carries out the LINPACK Benchmark.
    </p>

    <p>
      The LINPACK benchmark is a test problem used to rate the performance 
      of a computer on a simple linear algebra problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      The test problem requires the user to set up a random dense matrix
      <b>A</b> of size <b>N</b> = 1000, and a right hand side vector <b>B</b>
      which is the product of <b>A</b> and a vector <b>X</b> of all 1's.  
      The first task is to compute an LU factorization of <b>A</b>.  The 
      second task is to use the LU factorization to solve the linear system 
      <blockquote>
        <b>A</b> * <b>X</b> = <b>B</b>.
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The number of floating point operations required for these two
      tasks is roughly
      <blockquote>
        ops = 2 * N*N*N / 3 + 2 * N * N,
      </blockquote>
      therefore, the "MegaFLOPS" rating, or millions of floating point
      operations per second, can be found as
      <blockquote>
        mflops = ops / ( cpu * 1000000 ).
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      On a given computer, if you run the benchmark for a sequence of increasing
      values of N, the behavior of the MegaFLOPS rating will vary as you pass through
      three main zones of behavior:
      <ul>
        <li>
          a <i>rising</i> zone, as both the local cache memory and the processor
          are not challenged.
        </li>
        <li>
          a <i>flat</i> zone, where the processor is challenged, that is, it is
          performing at top efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
          a <i>decaying</i> zone, where the local cache memory is also challenged,
          that is the matrix is so large that the cache is not big enough to
          keep the necessary data close enough to the processor to keep it running
          at top speed.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
