      SATISFY <br> Seek Binary Circuit Inputs that Output 1
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SATISFY</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      demonstrates, for a particular circuit, an exhaustive search
      for solutions of the circuit satisfy problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      This problem assumes that we are given a logical circuit of AND, OR and NOT
      gates, with N binary inputs and a single output.  We are to determine all
      inputs which produce a 1 as the output.
    </p>

    <p>
      The general problem is NP complete, so there is no known polynomial-time
      algorithm to solve the general case.  The natural way to search for solutions
      then is exhaustive search.
    </p>

    <p>
      In an interesting way, this is a very extreme and discrete version of
      the problem of maximizing a scalar function of multiple variables.
      The difference is that here we know that both the input and output
      only have the values 0 and 1, rather than a continuous range of real
      values!
    </p>

    <p>
      This problem is a natural candidate for parallel computation, since
      the individual evaluations of the circuit are completely independent.
    </p>

    <p>
      The example circuit considered here has been described in conjunctive
      normal form ("CNF").  This is a standard format for logical formulas.
      At the highest level, the formula consists of <i>clauses</i> joined
      by the <b>AND</b> (conjunction) operator.  Each clause consists of
      <i>signed literals</i> joined by the <b>OR</b> (disjunction) operator.
      Each signed literal is either the name of a variable (positive literal), 
      or the name of a variable preceded by the <b>NOT</b> (negation) operator
      (a negative literal).  There is a CNF file format that can be used to
      store logical formulas that have been cast into conjunctive normal form.
