    <p>
      <b>TRIANGLE_GRID</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      generates a triangular grid of points.
    </p>

    <p>
      Starting with any 3 points A, B, and C that define a triangle,
      we can divide each side of the triangle into N subintervals,
      and create a triangular grid.  This defines ((N+1)*(N+2))/2
      points that lie on the intersections of grid lines.  The 
      arrangement is suggested by this diagram:
      <pre>
              X
             9 X
            8 9 X
           7 8 9 X
          6 7 8 9 X
         5 6 7 8 9 X
        4 5 6 7 8 9 X
       3 4 5 6 7 8 9 X
      2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 X
     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 X
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 X
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The library includes a routine which allows the user to pick an
      arbitrary triangle and an arbitrary number of subdivisions.  It
      then returns the triangular gridpoints defined by that choice.
