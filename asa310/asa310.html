      ASA310 <br> CDF of the noncentral Beta distribution
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ASA310</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      computes the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the
      noncentral Beta distribution,
      by Chattamvelli and Shanmugam.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>ASA310</b> is Applied Statistics Algorithm 310.  Source code for many
      Applied Statistics Algorithms is available through
      <a href = "http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/apstat">STATLIB</a>.

      <b>
        Note:
      </b>
      <i>
        I could not get this algorithm to perform properly until
        I had made a number of modifications.
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
        Note that the printed text of the algorithm, and the online version
        distributed by APSTAT, omit a crucial initialization of the variable
        S to zero.
        <p>
        Moreover, there are two typographical errors introduced into the
        online version distributed by APSTAT; in both cases a multiplication
        symbol became a minus sign.
        <p>
        Finally, note that the authors of AS 310 invoke AS 226, but specifically
        recommend that the changes submitted by Frick NOT be included.
        The version of AS 226 distributed by APSTAT includes the Frick changes;
        the version of AS310 distributed by APSTAT includes this copy of AS 226,
        and hence the changes suggested by Frick.
