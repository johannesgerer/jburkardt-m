      FEYNMAN_KAC_1D <br> PDE Solution by Feynman-Kac Algorithm
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEYNMAN_KAC_1D</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      demonstrates the use of the Feynman-Kac algorithm 
      to solve Poisson's equation in a 1D interval by averaging
      stochastic paths to the boundary.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is intended as a simple demonstration of the method.
      The main purpose is to have a version that runs sequentially, so that
      it can be compared to versions which have been enhanced using parallel
      programming techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original version of this code used stepsize parameter H = 0.0001 and
      sample size N = 10,000.  However, the MATLAB version of the code, with
      these parameters, ran much more slowly than the C, C++, F77 and F90 versions,
      and so H was increased to 0.01.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks to some comments from Arno Petri (call rand() rather than r8_uniform_01()), 
      and some other mysterious changes (comment out the return/end statements!)
      the performance of the MATLAB code has been significantly improved.
