      SQUARE_EXACTNESS <br> Exactness of 2D Quadrature Rules
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SQUARE_EXACTNESS</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      investigates the polynomial exactness of quadrature rules for f(x,y) 
      over the interior of a square (rectangle/quadrilateral) in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      We assume that the integral to be approximated is of a Legendre
      type, over a rectangular region:
      <pre>
        I(f) = integral ( c &lt;= y &lt;= d ) integral ( a &lt;= x &lt;= b ) f(x,y) dx dy
      </pre>
      and that such integrals are to be approximated by:
      <pre>
        Q(f) = sum ( 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N ) w(i) * f(x(i),y(i))
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      To determine the exactness of a given quadrature rule, we simply compare 
      the exact integral I(f) to the estimated integral Q(f) for a sequence of
      monomials of increasing total degree D.  This sequence begins with:
      <pre>
        D = 0:              1
        D = 1:          x        y
        D = 2:      x^2     xy        x^2
        D = 3:  x^3    x^2y     xy^2       y^3
      </pre>
      and the exactness of a quadrature rule is defined as the largest value 
      of D such that I(f) and Q(f) are equal for all monomials up to and
      including those of total degree D.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that if the 2D quadrature rule is formed as a product of
      two 1D rules, then knowledge of the 1D exactness of the individual
      factors gives sufficient information to determine the exactness
      of the product rule, which will simply be the minimum of the exactnesses
      of the two factor rules.
