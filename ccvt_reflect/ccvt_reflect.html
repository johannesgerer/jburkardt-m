      CCVT_REFLECT <br> Constrained CVT Algorithm
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CCVT_REFLECT</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      allows the user to specify certain parameters, and then
      creates a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation
      of points in a region, using a special reflection technique
      to try to attract some points to move to the boundary.
    </p>

    <p>
      The standard CVT algorithm will tend to place points uniformly
      inside the region, but will never place points <i>on</i> the boundary.
      However, in many cases, it would be very desirable to smoothly
      modify the set of points so that some of them fall on the boundary.
      This is the case, for instance, when the points are to be used to
      triangulate the region and define a finite element grid.
    </p>

    <p>
      The method for doing this relies on the observation that the
      generator points become uniformly distributed because they
      "push" each other away, by grabbing sample points.  The generator
      points do not approach the boundary too closely, because there
      are no sample points on the other side of the boundary.  In essence,
      the boundary also "pushes" the generator points away.
      By making "reflected" sample points whenever a generator is near 
      the boundary, we essentially neutralize the boundary effect, allowing
      the generator points in the interior to push a layer of generators
      onto the boundary.  In most cases, once a point hits the boundary,
      it will not leave, although it may continue to adjust its position
      on the boundary itself.
    </p>

      <i>
        This program is a "work in progress".  Currently, only a simple
        2D box region has been examined.  The next step is to work on
        more general 2D regions; then to make the natural extension to
        3D or arbitrary dimension.

    <p>
      <b>CCVT_REFLECT</b> is an experimental code; so far, the experiment
      is not doing well.  I haven't figured out yet how to make the
      points behave as well as they do for <b>CCVT_BOX</b>.  The idea is,
      though, that the method of pulling points to the boundary seems
      fairly natural and flexible to me, so maybe I just need to
      find the right way to implement it.
