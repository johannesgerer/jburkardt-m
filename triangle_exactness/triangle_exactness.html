      TRIANGLE_EXACTNESS <br> Exactness of Quadrature on Triangles
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGLE_EXACTNESS</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      investigates the polynomial exactness of a quadrature rule 
      over the interior of a triangle in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The polynomial exactness of a quadrature rule is defined as the
      highest total degree <b>D</b> such that the quadrature rule is
      guaranteed to integrate exactly all polynomials of total degree
      <b>DEGREE_MAX</b> or less, ignoring roundoff.
      The total degree of a polynomial is the maximum of the degrees 
      of all its monomial terms.  For a triangle, the degree of a monomial
      term is the sum of the exponents of <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>. 
      Thus, for instance, the <b>DEGREE</b> of 
      <blockquote><b>
        x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>5</sup>
      </b></blockquote>
      is 2+5=7.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be thorough, the program starts at <b>DEGREE</b> = 0, and then 
      proceeds to <b>DEGREE</b> = 1, 2, and so on up to a maximum degree 
      <b>DEGREE_MAX</b> specified by the user.  At each value of <b>DEGREE</b>,
      the program generates every possible monomial term, applies the 
      quadrature rule to it, and determines the quadrature error.  The program 
      uses a scaling factor on each monomial so that the exact integral 
      should always be 1; therefore, each reported error can be compared
      on a fixed scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is very flexible and interactive.  The quadrature rule 
      is defined by three files, to be read at input, and the 
      maximum degree is specified by the user as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the three files that define the quadrature rule
      are assumed to have related names, of the form
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>x.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>w.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>r.txt</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      When running the program, the user only enters the common <i>prefix</i> 
      part of the file names, which is enough information for the program
      to find all three files.
    </p>

    <p>
      The exactness results are written to an output file with the 
      corresponding name:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>exact.txt</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>triangle_exactness</b> ( '<i>prefix</i>', <i>degree_max</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i> is the common prefix for the files containing the abscissa, weight
          and region information of the quadrature rule;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>degree_max</i> is the maximum total monomial degree to check.  This should be
          a relatively small nonnegative number, particularly if the
          spatial dimension is high.  A value of 5 or 10 might be
          reasonable, but a value of 50 or 100 is probably never a
          good input!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If the arguments are not supplied on the command line, the
      program will prompt for them.
