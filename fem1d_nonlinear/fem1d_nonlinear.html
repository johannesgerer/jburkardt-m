      FEM1D_NONLINEAR <br> Finite Element Method for 1D Nonlinear Problem.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM1D_NONLINEAR</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      applies the finite element method to a simple nonlinear
      boundary value problem in one spatial dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      The nonlinear boundary problem involves an unknown function <b>u</b> on
      an interval <b>[a,b]</b>.  Typically, a single boundary condition, either
      <b>u(a)</b> or <b>u'(a)</b>, is given at the left endpoint, and
      <b>u(b)</b> or <b>u'(b)</b> at the right endpoint.  The associated differential
      equation, which must hold in the interior of <b>[a,b]</b>, happens to have
      the form:
      <pre>
        -d/dx ( p(x) du/dx ) + q(x) * u + u * du/dx = f(x)
      </pre>
      where <b>p(x)</b>, <b>q(x)</b> and <b>f(x)</b> are given functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The nonlinearity arises because of the term <b>u*du/dx</b>; if this term
      were not present, standard finite element techniques would allow the system
      to be set up and solved almost as easily as a linear system of algebraic
      equations is solved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Newton's method, which works well for scalar nonlinear equations, can also
      be applied to this problem, as long as we are willing to extend our notions
      of a function and derivative.  We need to imagine our differential equation
      as a function <b>F(u)</b>:
      <pre>
        F(u) = -d/dx ( p(x) du/dx ) + q(x) * u + u * du/dx - f(x)
      </pre>
      (with the boundary conditions wrapped in here somewhere as well!)
      If we differentiate this function, we get a Jacobian operator, which is
      evaluated at <b>u</b>, and applied to any small increment <b>v</b>.  This equation
      implicitly describes the tangent plane of solutions near to a given
      solution <b>u</b>.
      <pre>
        J(u,v) = -d/dx ( p(x) dv/dx ) + q(x) * v + u * dv/dx + v * du/dx
      </pre>
      Now if we apply the finite element formulation to represent <b>u</b> and
      <b>v</b> in terms of sums of basis functions, we can set up a linear
      system, to be evaluated at <b>u</b> and solved for the Newton increment
      <b>delta_u</b>:
      <pre>
        J(u,delta_u) = - F(u)
      </pre>
      By using the Newton increment to update <b>u</b> and repeating the process
      as needed, we can expect to get a good finite element solution of our original
      nonlinear boundary value problem.
