    <p>
      <b>MD</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which
      carries out a molecular dynamics simulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The computation involves following the paths of particles which
      exert a distance-dependent force on each other.  The particles
      are not constrained by any walls; if particles meet, they simply
      pass through each other.
    </p>

    </p>
      The problem is treated as a coupled set of differential equations.
      The system of differential equation is discretized by choosing a 
      discrete time step.  Given the position and velocity of each particle
      at one time step, the algorithm estimates these values at the next time step.
    </p>

    <p>
      To compute the next position of each particle requires the evaluation of 
      the right hand side of its corresponding differential equation.  Since each 
      of these calculations is independent, there is a potential speedup if the 
      program can take advantage of parallel computing.
    </p>

    <p>
      This version of the program is intended as a starting point; 
      students are asked to examine the program and add the appropriate
      parallel MATLAB modifications to run it in parallel.

      <blockquote>
        <b>md</b> ( <i>nd</i>, <i>np</i>, <i>step_num</i>, <i>dt</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where

        <li>
          <i>nd</i> is the spatial dimension, usually 2 or 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>np</i> is the number of particles in the system.  A typical value
          might be 1000.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>step_num</i> is the number of time steps, which might be 500
          or 1,000.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>dt</i> is the timestep size, which might be 0.1.
