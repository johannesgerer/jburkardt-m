      Quadrature Weights by Vandermonde Matrix
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>QUADRATURE_WEIGHTS_VANDERMONDE</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      illustrates a method for computing the weights of a quadrature
      rule, assuming that the points have been specified, by setting up
      a linear system involving the Vandermonde matrix.
    </p>   

    <p>
      We assume that the abscissas (quadrature points) have been chosen, 
      that the interval [A,B] is known, and that the integrals of polynomials 
      of degree 0 through N-1 can be computed.  The examples here use a 
      finite interval and a unit weight function, but the method can easily 
      be extended to non-finite intervals and non-unit weight functions.
    </p>

      The Vandermonde Matrix
    </h3>

    <p>
      We assume that the quadrature formula approximates integrals of the form:
      <pre>
        I(F) = Integral ( A <= X <= B ) F(X) dX 
      </pre>
      by specifying N points X and weights W such that
      <pre>
        Q(F) = Sum ( 1 <= I <= N ) W(I) * F(X(I))
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now let us assume that the points X have been specified, but that the
      corresponding values W remain to be determined.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we require that the quadrature rule with N points integrates the first
      N monomials exactly, then we have N conditions on the weights W.
    </p>

    <p>
      The I-th condition, for the monomial X^(I-1), has the form:
      <pre>
        W(1)*X(1)^(I-1) + W(2)*X(2)^(I-1)+...+W(N)*X(N)^(I-1) = (B^I-A^I)/I.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The corresponding matrix is known as the Vandermonde matrix.  It is
      theoretically guaranteed to be nonsingular as long as the X's are
      distinct, but its condition number grows quickly with N.  Therefore,
      this simple, direct approach is often abandoned when more accuracy
      or high order rules are needed.
