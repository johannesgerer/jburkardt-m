      WEDGE_EXACTNESS <br> Precision Test for Wedge Quadrature Rules
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>WEDGE_EXACTNESS</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      measures the precision of a quadrature rule
      over the interior of the unit wedge in 3D.
    </p>

     <p>
      The interior of the unit wedge in 3D is defined by the constraints:
      <pre>
        0 <= X
        0 <= Y
             X + Y <= 1
       -1 <= Z <= +1
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>wedge_exactness</b> <i>filename</i> <i>degree_max</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>filename</i> is the common prefix of the filenames containing the
          abscissas and the weights of the quadrature rule.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>degree_max</i> is the maximum degree of the monomials to be checked.
